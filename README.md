# 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE (FORKED)

This is a data fork from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for parsing and integration into the [COVID-19 dashboard](https://cypressriveradvisors.shinyapps.io/covid-19/) for [Cypress River Advisors](https://www.cypressriveradvisors.com/). 

This file contains data files under /parsed_data/ in feather format for cross compatibility between the Python parser and the Shiny R framework that visualizes it. The parser to generate these files may also be found here.
